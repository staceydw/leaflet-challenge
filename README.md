The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

In this challenge, the task is to develop a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

This activity is broken into two parts:
Part 1: Earthquake Visualization
Part 2: Plotting of further data

Using Leaflet, a map was created that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude. Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

ChatGPT was used for the HTML document and for help customizing the visualizations.
